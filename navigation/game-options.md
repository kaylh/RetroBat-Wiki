From this menu, you will be able to:

* View Game Manual, Video and Media
* Manage Game (saves, find similar games, delete game)
* Add Game to favorites
* Scrape Game / Edit Game Metadata
* Define specific Game Options

### Advanced Game Options

You have the ability to define at a game level the same options that you can define at System level.

The **ADVANCED GAME OPTIONS** can be used when you need to define for a game a setting that differs from the [system settings](view-options.md#advanced-system-options).
