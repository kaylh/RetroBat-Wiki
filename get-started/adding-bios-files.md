# Adding BIOS files

BIOS files are files required for some emulators to operate correctly.&#x20;

### Location

BIOS files must be placed in the `\bios` folder in your Retrobat installation:

### Missing BIOS check

From the [GAME SETTINGS](../navigation/main-menu.md#game-settings) in the [MAIN MENU](../navigation/main-menu.md), you have the possibility to perform a check for missing BIOS:

The missing BIOS appear with a broken chain icon. The ones where the md5 hash is not listed by Retrobat will appear with a ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>) icon.
