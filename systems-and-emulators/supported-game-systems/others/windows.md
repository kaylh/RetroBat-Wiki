### Adding a Steam game

{% hint style="info" %}
The Batgui tool offers a simplified procedure for adding Steam game, refer to the [Batgui](../../../advanced-features/batgui.md) section of the Wiki.
{% endhint %}

Create a .bat file with a scrapable name for your game.

You have 2 possibilities, quit Steam at the end of each game or not, both work since it seems that emulationstation is waiting on the end of the execution of the script to reactivate.

The solution without switching off Steam launches the games faster since the connection step is no longer to be done once launched for the first time or if Steam is launched when Windows starts.

This is code of your .bat file **with Steam kill**:

<pre class="language-batch"><code class="lang-batch"><strong>@echo OFF
</strong>
REM HERE MODIFY YOUR STEAM APPID:
START steam://rungameid/000000

TIMEOUT /t 30
:RUNNING

REM HERE YOU MUST ENTER THE RIGHT NAME OF THE EXECUTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE: "MyGame.exe"
tasklist|findstr "Mygame.exe" > nul

if %errorlevel%==1 timeout /t 5 &#x26; taskkill /F /IM Steam.exe /T &#x26; GOTO ENDLOOP</code></pre>

This is code of your .bat file **without Steam kill**:

```batch
@echo OFF

REM HERE MODIFY YOUR STEAM APPID:
START steam://rungameid/000000

TIMEOUT /t 30
:RUNNING

REM HERE YOU MUST ENTER THE RIGHT NAME OF THE EXECUTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE: "MyGame.exe"
tasklist|findstr "Mygame.exe" > nul

if %errorlevel%==1 timeout /t 5 & GOTO ENDLOOP
```

**All you need is to inquire Steam game ID and executable name, proceed as follows:**

Open steam then check "Activate Steam address bar when available", also make sure that Steam does not start in big picture mode.

You will then find your game id at the top left in the address bar, from the store page.

Alternatively, you can find the full "start" command in the properties of a Steam game shortcut:

Then find the game executable as follows:

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively you could run the game and open the task manager to find the executable name.
{% endhint %}

Finally, report these two pieces of information in your.bat file as follows:
