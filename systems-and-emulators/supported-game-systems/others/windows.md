### Adding a Steam game

{% hint style="info" %}
The Batgui tool offers a simplified procedure for adding Steam game, refer to the [Batgui](../../../advanced-features/batgui.md) section of the Wiki.
{% endhint %}

Create a .bat file with a scrapable name for your game.

You have 2 possibilities, quit Steam at the end of each game or not, both work since emulationstation is waiting on the end of the execution of the script to reactivate.

The solution without switching off Steam launches the games faster since the connection step is no longer required once launched for the first time, same This is code of your .bat file **with Steam kill**:

if Steam is launched when Windows starts.

This is code of your .bat file **with Steam kill**:

<pre class="language-batch"><code class="lang-batch"><strong>@echo OFF
</strong>
REM HERE MODIFY YOUR STEAM APPID:
START steam://rungameid/000000

TIMEOUT /t 30
:RUNNING

REM HERE YOU MUST ENTER THE RIGHT NAME OF THE EXECUTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE: "MyGame.exe"
tasklist|findstr "Mygame.exe" > nul

if %errorlevel%==1 timeout /t 5 &#x26; taskkill /F /IM Steam.exe /T &#x26; GOTO ENDLOOP
timeout /t 2
GOTO RUNNING
:ENDLOOP
</code></pre>

This is code of your .bat file **without Steam kill**:

```batch
@echo OFF

REM HERE MODIFY YOUR STEAM APPID:
START steam://rungameid/000000

TIMEOUT /t 30
:RUNNING

REM HERE YOU MUST ENTER THE RIGHT NAME OF THE EXECUTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE: "MyGame.exe"
tasklist|findstr "Mygame.exe" > nul

if %errorlevel%==1 timeout /t 5 & GOTO ENDLOOP
timeout /t 2
GOTO RUNNING
:ENDLOOP
```

**All you need is to inquire Steam game ID and executable name, proceed as follows:**

Open steam then check "Activate Steam address bar when available", also make sure that Steam does not start in big picture mode.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oQssKE7.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

You will then find your game id at the top left in the address bar, from the store page.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Po6FSrn.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Alternatively, you can find the full "start" command in the properties of a Steam game shortcut:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/90ZcRdF.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Then find the game executable as follows:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CCVHbSs.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CBLOJwn.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively you could run the game and open the task manager to find the executable name.
{% endhint %}

Next, report these two pieces of information in your.bat file as follows:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CHGYrxn.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Finally save the bat file in the `roms\windows` folder of your RetroBat installation.

### Adding a game from EPIC Game Store

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to ensure that the EPIC Game Launcher is set to automatically login, else the login window might appear.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 1:&#x20;

Place the game shortcut generated by the Epic Launcher in a folder inside the`roms\windows\.EPIC\` folder in your RetroBat installation folder:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZkFCDNI.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to create the .EPIC folder as it is not created by default with RetroBat installation.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 2:

Create a .bat file with a scrapable name for your game.

You have 2 possibilities, quit EpicGameLauncher at the end of each game or not, both work since emulationstation is waiting on the end of the execution of the script to reactivate.

The solution without switching off the Epic Launcher launches the games faster since the connection step is no longer to be done once launched for the first time or if Epic Game Launcher is launched when Windows starts.&#x20;

This is code of your .bat file **with EpicGameLauncher kill**:

```batch
@echo OFF

REM HERE MODIFY YOUR EPIC GAME SHORTCUT URL:
START "" "C:\retrobat\roms\windows\.EPIC\Game shortcut.url"

TIMEOUT /t 30
:RUNNING

REM HERE YOU MUST ENTER THE Right NAME of THE EXECUTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE: "MyGame.exe"
tasklist|findstr "MyGame.exe" > nul

IF %errorlevel%==1 timeout /t 5 & taskkill /F /IM EpicGamesLauncher.exe /T & GOTO ENDLOOP
timeout /t 2
GOTO RUNNING
:ENDLOOP
```

This is code of your .bat file **without EpicGameLauncher kill**:

```batch
@echo OFF

REM HERE MODIFY YOUR EPIC GAME SHORTCUT URL:
START "" "C:\retrobat\roms\windows\.EPIC\Game shortcut.url"

TIMEOUT /t 30
:RUNNING

REM HERE YOU MUST ENTER THE Right NAME of THE EXECUTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE: "MyGame.exe"
tasklist|findstr "MyGame.exe" > nul

IF %errorlevel%==1 timeout /t 5 & GOTO ENDLOOP
timeout /t 2
GOTO RUNNING
:ENDLOOP
```

#### Step 3:

Place the bat file created in step 2 in the `roms\windows` folder of your RetroBat installation:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gxEOZNB.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Ensure to have the right information in the 2 following places in the .bat file:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FiGNJLZ.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

The first one is the exact location of the shortcut as explained in step 1.

The second one is the game executable name, this is necessary to ensure that RetroBat is waiting until the end of the process to come back to the the RetroBat interface.

You can find the executable name in the game install folder on your hard drive or in the Windows task manager while running the game:

### Adding an UBISOFT game (Ubisoft Connect)

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to ensure that the Ubisoft Connect Launcher is set to automatically login, else the login window might appear.
{% endhint %}

Create a .bat file with a scrapable name for your game.

You have 2 possibilities, quit Ubisoft Connect at the end of each game or not, both work since emulationstation is waiting on the end of the execution of the script to reactivate.

The solution without switching off Unbisoft Connect launches the games faster since the connection step is no longer required once launched for the first time, same if Ubisoft Connect is launched when Windows starts.

This is code of your .bat file **with Ubisoft Connect kill**:

```batch
@echo OFF

REM HERE MODIFY YOUR UBISOFT APPID:
START uplay://launch/00000/0

TIMEOUT /t 30
:RUNNING

REM HERE YOU MUST ENTER THE Right NAME of THE EXECUTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE: "MyGame.exe"
tasklist|findstr "MyGame.exe" > nul

IF %errorlevel%==1 timeout /t 5 & taskkill /F /IM upc.exe /T & GOTO ENDLOOP
timeout /t 2
GOTO RUNNING
:ENDLOOP
```

This is code of your .bat file **without Ubisoft Connect kill**:

```batch
@echo OFF

REM HERE MODIFY YOUR UBISOFT APPID:
START uplay://launch/00000/0

TIMEOUT /t 30
:RUNNING

REM HERE YOU MUST ENTER THE Right NAME of THE EXECUTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE: "MyGame.exe"
tasklist|findstr "MyGame.exe" > nul

IF %errorlevel%==1 timeout /t 5 & GOTO ENDLOOP
timeout /t 2
GOTO RUNNING
:ENDLOOP
```

**All you need is to inquire Ubisoft game launch command and executable name, proceed as follows:**

Open Ubisoft Connect, then select your installed game and choose to "Create desktop shortcut":

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BlqMJIB.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Right-click the created shortcut and retrieve the launch command from the shortcut properties:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MmzV6ec.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Next find the game executable as follows:

From Ubisoft Connect, open Game details and go to properties:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rdBgCA7.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Click the "Open folder" button in the Local files section and find the game executable name:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CT9qODE.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively you could run the game and open the task manager to find the executable name.
{% endhint %}

Next, report these two pieces of information in your.bat file as follows:

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BAx77xx.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Finally save the bat file in the `roms\windows` folder of your RetroBat installation.
