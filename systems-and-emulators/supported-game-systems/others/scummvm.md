## BIOS

No specific BIOS is required to play ScummVM games.

## Controls

Most of the games are point-and-click games designed to be played with a mouse. If you don't have a mouse, the left analog stick can be used too.

Manual controls can be configured by adding a [pad2key ](../../../controllers/pad2key.md)profile for the game.

## System Features

### Adding games

Scummvm games must be in separate folders, in the `\roms\scummvm` folder.

In each games folder, create a .txt file with the name of the game, for example **Full Throttle.txt** for Full Throttle.

In the .txt file, enter the ScummVM **game shortname**, refer to [https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/](https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/) to get the correct shortname.

Finally, rename the \*._txt_ files into \*._scummvm_ file, for example:\
\
Full Throttle.**txt**  **==>** Full Throttle.**scummvm**
