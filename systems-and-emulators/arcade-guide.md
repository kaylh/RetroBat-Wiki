## Emulators

There are two families of multi-system arcade emulators available: FinalBurn and MAME.&#x20;

These emulators are available in multiple versions to allow users to best match a core/emulator with their games.&#x20;

## ROMs

### Terminology

* **ROM, ROM set, and romset**: Arcade games are packaged as zip files, most of which are composed of more than one individual 'ROM' file. \
  That is why some resources refer to an individual arcade game as a ROM while other resources refer to an individual game as a ROM set or romset.\

* **ROM version or romset version**: Each version of an arcade emulator must be used with ROMs that have the same exact version number. \
  For example, MAME 0.37b5 ROMs are required by the MAME 2000 emulator, but will not work correctly with the MAME 2010 emulator, which requires MAME 0.139 ROMs.\


### ROM set types

Arcade ROMs can be formatted four ways:

* **Full Non-merged**: All romsets can be used standalone because each zip contains all the files needed to run that game, including any ROMs from 'parent' ROM sets and BIOS sets.\

* **Non-merged ROM**: All romsets can be used standalone because each zip contains all the files needed to run that game, including any files from 'parent romsets'. \
  The only exceptions are games which use BIOS ROMs, which are formatted as 'Split' and must be kept in the same folder as the game romset which uses it.\

* **Split**: Some romsets that are considered clones, translations, or bootlegs also require a "parent" romset to run. In some cases the parent is not the most popular or best working version of the game, however. \
  For example, in a Split set `pacman.zip` (a clone), will not work without `puckman.zip` (its parent).\

* **Merged**: Clones are merged into the parent romset zip, meaning that more than one game is stored per file. \


{% hint style="warning" %}
Merged rom sets are not supported by libretro cores.&#x20;

We recommend the use of Non-merged rom sets.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not rename the zipped ROM files. Scrapers will recognize the games with the .zip filename and match them with the right game.
{% endhint %}

## Additional files

### Samples

Some games need extra samples files to work, they should be placed in the following folders:

* For fbneo: `\bios\fbneo\samples`
* For mame2003: `\bios\mame2003\samples`
* For mame2003plus: `\bios\mame2003-plus\samples`
* For mame2010: `\bios\mame2010\samples`
* For the current mame and standalone mame: `\bios\mame\samples`

### CHD or IMG files

Some arcade games can use extra files (originally these were physically stored on a disc) called CHD (sometimes IMG).&#x20;

The CHD folder must be placed in the rom folder and must have the same name as the game's ZIP file.&#x20;

For example, for `kinst.zip` the game will be looking for `kinst/kinst.chd`.
