This issue has been raised in v5.1 when people use twice the same model of controllers.

The issue has been fixed and will be officially provided with v5.1.1, however you can fix it now by downloading this file and unzipping the content inside the `\emulationstation` folder of your RetroBat installation.

## PinballFX3 not launching tables automatically

With V5.1, there is a regression with PinballFX3, tables will not launch automatically, instead the game will present the game menu.

To fix this, download the following file and extract its content in the `eumlationstation\` folder of your RetroBat installation.

This will replace your existing "EmulatorLauncher.exe" file and fix the issue.
