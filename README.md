# Welcome!

This wiki is the official RetroBat documentation.



You can use the main menu on the left hand side to navigate through the sections of the wiki.&#x20;

* If you are a beginner with RetroBat, you can head to the [GET STARTED](get-started/prerequisites.md) section and let it guide you through the installation and first setup phase.
* If you are an advanced user and you are looking for information about a specific Game System, you can head over to the [SUPPORTED GAME SYSTEMS](supported-game-systems/) section, which will provide information about available emulators, BIOS requirements and detailed per-system features.
* The [ADVANCED FEATURES](broken-reference) section contains information about specific functionalities provided with RetroBat



The RetroBat team has also included some specific [TUTORIALS](broken-reference) that will be enhanced by the Team based on common support requirements.
